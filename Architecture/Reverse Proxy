Reverse Proxy
    A facade to services that sits on the edge of the networks. 

Pros:
    1) Advanced Security - Server IP is invisible and Blacklisting of incoming IP address
    2) Scalability and Flexibility - Changing the Server config with load balance

Additional Benifits:
    Web Acceleration
        1 - Compress of server response
        2 - SSL termination => Encrypting/Decrypting request and responses freeing up Server
        3 - Caching => Caches server response
