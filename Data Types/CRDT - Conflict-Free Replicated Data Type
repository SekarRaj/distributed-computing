Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT)
    Data structure that can be replicated across network and can be updated concurrently and independently without any co-ordination services. 
    It is always possible to resolve inconsistencies that might result.

Types:
    1) Operations based CRDT a.k.a CmRDT (Cummulative Replicated Data Types) propogates states by transmitting only the update operations.
    2) State based CRDT a.k.a CvRDT (Convergent Replicated Data Types) propogates the entire state and each node converges the entire state using join.
