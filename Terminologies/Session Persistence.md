Session Persistence
    Session Persistence refers to sending all requests from a particular client to the same sever for the duration of the transaction/session.
    
Pros:
    1) Servers store/cache user data of the ongoing transaction.
    2) Server can pre-cache data depending on user request.
    3) Large document can be broken and sent as multiple request-responses.

Methodology
    1) Cookies
    2) Sticky Routes
